# Overview

`iso-tool` is a shell script for generating Nitrux ISO files. The code is very readable and so self-documented.

This branch generates an ISO file with NX Desktop. The ISO image generated in this branch utilizes [Calamares](https://calamares.io/) as its installer.

Please refer to our tutorial ["How to install Nitrux"](https://nxos.org/tutorial/how-to-install-nitrux/) for more information about how to flash this ISO and install it to a storage device.
